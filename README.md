# EEG/MEG Data Pre-processing and Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the pre-processing and analysis of EEG/MEG data. The primary objectives are to clean, transform, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights and patterns. The project utilizes various machine learning and statistical techniques to enhance the quality of the data and perform robust analysis.

## Features
- **Data Pre-processing**: Cleaning and transforming raw EEG/MEG data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifying significant features from the data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing the data for better understanding and interpretation.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Applying machine learning algorithms to analyze the data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducting various statistical tests and models to validate findings.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, MNE, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tinopenchev/EEG-MEG-Data-Preprocessing-and-Analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd EEG-MEG-Data-Preprocessing-and-Analysis
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To run the project, open the `EEG:MEG data pre-processing and analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
